# Facebook-Battle-Royale-Game

A game made with unity. A list of names is used to generate NPCs to have a silly little battle royalegame.

The idea was to get the list of one's facebook friends and save it into a file using the facebook API, but the api only retrieves names of those who played the game. However, facebook does have a way of giving it's list of friends, but it is not yet implemented in the code. I will some time in the future.

The game is semi functional and has a prototype built already. However, in order to change the list of names, the game needs to be built again.

Also there are no different abilities and appearances yet.
