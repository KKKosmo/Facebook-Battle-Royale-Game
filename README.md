# Facebook-Battle-Royale-Game

A game made with unity. A bunch of NPCs that gets their names from a text file are generated to have a silly little battle royale game.

The idea was to get the list of one's facebook friends and save it into a file using the facebook API, but the api only retrieves names of friends who have installed the game. However, facebook does have their official way of giving it's list of friends even without installing anything, but it is not yet implemented in the code. I will some time in the future.

The game is semi functional and has a prototype built already. However, in order to change the list of names, the game needs to be built again.

Also there are no different abilities and appearances yet.


I learned about file handling, json files, encryption
The "game master" can be improved, has bugs and lacks controls
