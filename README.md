# Facebook-Battle-Royale-Game

A game made with unity. A list of names is used to generate NPCs to have a silly little battle royale game.

The idea was to get the list of one's facebook friends and save it into a file using the facebook API, but the api only retrieves names of those who have installed the game. However, facebook does have their official way of giving it's list of friends even without installing anything, but it is not yet implemented in the code. I will some time in the future.

The game is semi functional and has a prototype built already. However, in order to change the list of names, the game needs to be built again.

Also there are no different abilities and appearances yet.
